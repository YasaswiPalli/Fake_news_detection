# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project is focused on detecting fake news using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It provides a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to help users and organizations identify misinformation in news articles.

## Features
- Multiple ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes,Support Vector Machine (SVM),Logistic Regression,Random Forest)
- Robust data preprocessing and cleaning
- Comprehensive model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Web app and API deployment options
- Modular and well-organized codebase

## Live Demo
